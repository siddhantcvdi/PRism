# PRism

PRism is a powerful tool designed for developers, open source enthusiasts, and newcomers alike. It tracks merged pull requests (PRs) from repositories of interest and provides insightful summaries generated by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. By analyzing code diffs, PRism delivers detailed insights into what each PR does and why it matters, helping users quickly understand code changes, coding styles, and code quality.

## Features

- **Merged PR Tracking:** Monitor and track merged PRs across your favorite repositories.
- **Insightful Summaries:** Automatically generated PR summaries that analyze code diffs to explain changes and their impact.
- **Educational Aid:** Helps newcomers learn from established coding styles and best practices used in open source projects.
- **Enhanced Code Review:** Assists maintainers and contributors in understanding and evaluating PRs quickly.
- **Future Chat Integration:** Plans to integrate a chat feature with the RAG, allowing interactive querying about repositories and specific PRs.
- **Issues RAG:** Upcoming functionality to generate summaries for issues, offering actionable insights and guidance.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **RAG Pipeline:**
  - Python
  - Langchain
  - FastAPI
- **LLM Integration:** Leveraging language models to interpret and summarize code diffs

## Architecture Overview

1. **Frontend (React.js):**  
   Provides an intuitive user interface for exploring repositories, tracking PRs, and viewing summaries.

2. **Backend (Node.js):**  
   Manages API requests, user authentication, and repository tracking.

3. **RAG Pipeline (Python, Langchain, FastAPI):**  
   Analyzes code diffs from PRs using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach, generating detailed summaries and insights.

4. **LLM Integration:**  
   Utilizes language models to understand the context and significance of code changes, producing human-readable summaries.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- Python (v3.8 or above)
- Package Manager (npm or yarn for Node.js, pip for Python)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prism.git
cd prism
```

### Setup the Backend

Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Start the Node.js server:

```bash
npm start
```

### Setup the RAG Service

Navigate to the RAG service directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd ../llm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Setup the Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

Start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

1. **Tracking PRs**:
   Use the intuitive dashboard to subscribe to repositories and view tracked merged PRs.

2. **Viewing Summaries**:
   Click on any PR to see the automatically generated summary. These insights will help you understand the code changes, the reasoning behind them, and their potential impact on the project.

3. **Future Interactions**:
   Once the chat feature is implemented, you can interact with the RAG system to ask follow-up questions about specific repositories or PRs, further deepening your understanding.
